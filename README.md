🚀 How It Works

When the page loads, it fetches the latest headlines from both NewsAPI and GNews.

Articles are displayed as flashcards (image, title, description, link).

Users can filter by category (Technology, Health, Business, etc.).

Users can also search articles by keywords.

Every hour, the news refreshes automatically.
